## File Parser for payments

In this API you are able to either parse all files in the folder "TextFilesToParse" or you parse a single file by just writing a destination for a File to be parsed.

## Want to parse your own Text File?

To add your own kind of text file to parse simply add it in the Enum TextFiles and add the unique start variables in PostType for the code to know what section of the file is it currently in. 

Be sure to know where in the String line your values contains to be able to parse it perfectly.

## Not sure if you have done it correctly?

Simply just use my Test cases on your file to be sure it all works fine!
